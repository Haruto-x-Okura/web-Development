Scientific Calculator with Graphing Support

A modern scientific calculator web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring advanced mathematical operations and graph visualization powered by Desmos.
This project demonstrates clean front-end structuring, proper separation of concerns, and practical use of third-party APIs.

🚀 Features

Basic arithmetic operations (+, −, ×, ÷)

Advanced scientific functions:

Trigonometric & inverse trigonometric functions

Logarithmic and exponential functions

Roots, powers, factorials, absolute values

Mathematical constants (π, e, √2)

Expression-based input (supports brackets and variables)

Graph plotting using Desmos API

Responsive and user-friendly UI

Modular file structure (HTML, CSS, JS separated)

🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML5 – Structure and layout

CSS3 – Styling and responsive design

JavaScript (ES6) – Logic and interactivity

Desmos API – Graph visualization

Font Awesome – Icons



📊 Graphing Support

Uses Desmos Graphing Calculator API

Supports expressions involving variable x

Example inputs:

x^2

sin(x)

x^3 + 2x

Click “Graph Expression” to visualize

🧠 How It Works

User inputs expressions via buttons

JavaScript handles expression building and evaluation

On graph request:

Expression is passed to Desmos

Graph is rendered dynamically

Errors are handled gracefully for invalid inputs
